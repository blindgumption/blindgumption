## About BlindGumption Documentation

I wanted somewhere other than the README (and other markdown) files in the github repo to document what I'm doing with BlindGumption.
At some point, blindgumption.com will/might have a blog of its own.  Some documentation will be moved there.  Specifically, I plan to write about what I'm working on, challenges I'm facing, and how I resolve them.
