# Welcome to BlindGumption

how to make the readme go away from pages...

Today is the 2nd of September, 2023, about three years since I started blindgumption.com, and a year since I updated it with some thoughts on how I might proceed.
Now is that time to proceed.

I've archived 
[the original blindgumption repo](https://github.com/blindgumption/original-blindgumption)
and created this new one.
And, if you're nostalgic, you can find
[the original blindgumption.com content on my github pages](https://joeldodson.github.io/mainBlindGumptionOriginalContent/index.html).

## The Best Laid Schemes o' Mice an' Men

To keep this README focused on ... well, I guess more to keep my ramblings from being a distraction, I've created a 
[Captain's Log](CAPTAINSLOG.md).
There you will find my thoughts on what to do, and how to do it, with blindgumption.

I'll also keep a 
[Change Log](CHANGELOG.md)
to see how much of the Captain's Log becomes reality.
